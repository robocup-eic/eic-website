Appearing during the semi-final.\n\nThis task tests the robot's interactivity with the synergy of navigation, manipulation, NLP, and Computer Vision.\n\nSimulating a restaurant, the robot is placed in the dining area looking for a customer to usher. When the customer raised their hand, the robot walks over and takes requests from the customer whether it is taking an order, getting the bill, etc. The robot then serves the customer their food and begins the process all over again."

The new detection, itâ€™s able to detect joints faster, and more accurately, and able to differentiate people in crowded areas better"
